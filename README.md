First repos tutorial for using GitHub

Hello, everyone!

This is the first GitHub tutorial for myself showing how I can use GitHub to store my work and share them.
Before I found and started considering using GitHub, I manually create backups for my projects, something like this:
- /project 1/
- /project 1 - v1.01/
- /project 1 - v1.02/
- etc...

This... was very annoying and I was always afraid I would miss something by accident! But now, I found GitHub and learnt the usefulness of "commit" and "branches" I feel like this is make project production much more faster and... the backups will be more "clean" and easier to read haha.

That's it! Thanks for reading my gibberish...
